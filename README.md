# lipo-liion-load-sharing

1. This application has been created in order to have perform a load sharing capabilities of li-ion battery when it is used in parallel with a lipo battery.

2. For operating batteries in parallel their initial voltages must be same. As it is not advisable to go beyond 4.1v with li-ion battery we reduce our lipo battery voltage to 4.1v. Doing this we may not use lipo's full capacity
